=============

Requirements: a webserver, PHP 5.5, Python 2.7, sqlite modules for Python and PHP, cron.

A webapp to check the (nearly) worldwide availability of Google Play Store devices.

Makes uses of proxies in all Play Store countries to retrieve device statuses.

Don't judge the ugliness of the code as it's a rewrite of an application I wrote one night when I knew very little about coding.
